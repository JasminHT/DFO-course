<h2>Page 13 – Unit 1.3 Stock Status and Reference Points</h2>

<p><i>[background music begins]</i></p>
<p><i>[Visual: The words, “Stock Status and Reference Points” appear.]</i></p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>This figure shows how the amount of fish that can be removed from a stock&nbsp;might change&nbsp;for each stock status zone (critical, cautious, or healthy). </p>
<p><i>[Visual: The graph appears with Removal Rate on the y axis, and Stock Status on the x axis. Below the graph, a legend displays “1 Limit Reference Point; 2 Upper Stock Reference Point; 3 Removal Reference; 4 Target Reference.”]</i></p>
<p><i>[Visual: At the top, the graph is divided into three sections and colours; a horizontal red bar on the far left is labelled “Critical zone”, a horizontal yellow bar in the middle is labelled “Cautious Zone”, and a horizontal green bar on the far right is labelled “Healthy Zone.”]</i></p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>When a stock is in the healthy zone, the removal rate can remain constant (as you can see in 3); </p>
<p><i>[Visual: A horizontal solid line labelled 3 is displayed in the Healthy Zone section on the far right.]</i></p>
<p>The vertical dotted line, 4, shows the target reference point,&nbsp;where managers would generally like the stock to be. </p>
<p><i>[Visual: The horizontal line labelled 3 is intersected by a perpendicular vertical dotted line labelled 4, also in the Healthy Zone section of the graph.] </p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>However, when the stock enters the cautious zone, fishing must be progressively reduced to avoid reaching the Limit Reference Point&nbsp;or LRP. You can see the dotted line descending lower and lower until it hits the LRP,&nbsp;showing how fishing rates might be reduced in the cautious zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>[Visual: The number 1 appears on the graph at the intersection of the far left “critical zone” and middle “cautious zone” denoting the location of the Limit Reference Point. A descending diagonal dotted line labelled 2 is displayed across the middle “cautious zone” section of the graph, connecting the horizontal line in the far right “healthy zone” section to the x axis at the intersection between the middle “cautious zone” and far left “critical zone” sections.]</i></p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>Below the LRP, fishing is kept at the lowest possible level to promote stock growth and&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;serious&nbsp;harm to the stock.&nbsp;</p>

Age is on the x-axis from 0 on the left to 13 on the right. Blue circles are displayed at the intersection for each age and each year, varying in size based on the number of fish in the cohort.]</i></p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>As cohorts get older from one year to the next, the number of fish in that year-class declines as they die naturally and are fished.</p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>The yellow circles represent the 2013 year-class at age 1 in 2014 to age 9 in 2022. </p>
<p><i>[Visual: The 2013 year one age-class is highlighted at the intersection of 2013 and 1 with a large yellow circle. More yellow circles appear in a diagonal descending slope from Age 1 to 9 that gradually reduce in size as time progresses to the most recent year (2022).]</i></p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>The size of the circles represents the total number of fish at each age for each year. </p>
<p><i>Narrator: </i>Cohort size varies between years: 1995, 1999, and 2000 had many 1-year-old fish, </p>
<p><i>[Visual: Three large circles in the age 1 column are highlighted in green in sequence, starting with 1995, 1999, and 2000, respectively.]</i></p>
