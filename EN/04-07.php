<p>Invited DFO participants must identify to their supervisor and the meeting chair(s) any conflict of interest they may hold before and during their involvement. It will then be determined if the employee can remain objective throughout the science advisory process. </p>
Invited external participants must determine for themselves whether a real, perceived, or potential conflict they may hold can be managed and if they can remain objective during the CSAS process. 

<p>Meeting chair(s) or CSAS coordinators, with input from the Steering Committee, may determine if action is warranted to address a real, perceived, or potential conflict of interest. </p>
