      <p>[Visual: The words, “Science Advisory Process Overview” appear.]</p>

      <p>Narrator: Let’s take a closer look at the steps that the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat uses to determine participation, scope, and other elements in Science Advisory Processes.</p>
      <p>[Visual: A circular figure appears (similar to a pie chart) that has 8 multi-coloured sections, each representing a step in the process. The title “CSAS Process” appears in the centre of the figure.]</p>

      <p>[Visual: section 1 of the circular figure is highlighted. The following text appears on the right half of the screen: Step 1. A call for requests for science advice is launched within Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Requests are driven by decision-making needs of the Department, which are based on Departmental priorities and engagement with stakeholders and other partners.]</p>

      <p>[Visual: section 5 of the circular figure is highlighted. The following text appears on the left half of the screen: Step 5. Scientists collect and analyze data and prepare working papers for peer review. Working papers include technical and scientific information. They are not science advice, but contain the supporting information and analyses needed to generate advice. They do not recommend policy options.]</p>
