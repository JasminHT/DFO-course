<p>Stock assessment <span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Models: tools used to simplify a natural system so it can be more easily understood.">models</abbr></span> range in complexity depending on the types and amount of data available and included. Different <b>parameters</b> (numbers that summarize a measurable characteristic of a stock) are used to describe background information. </p>
<ul>
  <li>For data-rich stocks, parameters may be based on actual data. </li>
  <li>For stocks with limited data, parameters may be estimated based on knowledge of similar or related species. </li>
</ul>

<p>Different models have different strengths and weaknesses and are appropriate for different types or amounts of data. Scientists choose the types of models best suited to assessing each stock and may use multiple models. </p>

<p>Many other types of models exist, and more are being developed with increasing complexity that are not covered in this training. </p>
