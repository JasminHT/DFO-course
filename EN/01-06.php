    <p><span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Rights-holders: modern successors to the Indigenous collectives that signed treaties, occupied and used land, and engaged in historic practices that support a finding of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title.">Rights-holders</abbr></span> and stakeholders play an important role in fisheries science in Canada. They may have a keen interest in supporting stock assessment because of their direct connection with fish stocks. They may have expertise, vessels, and gear to contribute towards research and monitoring. As such, DFO engages with: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis)</li>
      <li>provincial and territorial governments </li>
      <li>fishing and other industry professionals</li>
      <li>academia </li>
      <li>non-government organizations (NGOs)</li>
      <li>public </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This collaboration helps to: </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>improve fisheries science and management</li>
      <li>promote a greater understanding of fisheries in Canada</li>
      <li>strengthen relationships with Rights-holders and stakeholders </li>
    </ul>
