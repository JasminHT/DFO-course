<h2> Unit 1.2: What is stock assessment? </h2>
<p><strong>Stock-recruitment relationships</strong> are often important to stock assessments. They are the relationships between the <span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Abundance (N): total number of fish in a stock.">abundance</abbr></span> or <span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Biomass (B): the total weight of all fish in a stock.">biomass</abbr></span> of spawning adults in a stock and the expected number of recruits they can produce each year. In other words, the number of young fish in a stock depends on the number of mature fish that can reproduce each year. 
Where possible, these relationships can help determine the extent to which a fish stock can be harvested (or, how many fish are available to catch and how many should be left in the water to reproduce). </p>

<p>Information that can help determine a stockâ€™s stock-recruitment relationship includes:

    <summary><strong>Steepness or recruitment compensation</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Steepness or recruitment compensation</strong> is a measure of juvenile fish survival when there is little or no competition for resources (for example, food or habitat). </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class='collapsible blue' id="module2">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Spawning potential ratio </strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Spawning potential ratio </strong>is the number of eggs produced by a fish stock being fished relative to number of eggs that would be produced if it is not fished. </p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module3">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Yield per recruit</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Yield per recruit</strong> is the expected lifetime catch in weight produced per recruited fish in the stock.</p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module4">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Unfished biomass </strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Unfished biomass </strong>is the total weight of fish that would exist in a stock if it is not fished. </p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module5">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Unfished recruitment </strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Unfished recruitment </strong>is the expected recruitment if the fish stock is not fished. </p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module6">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Depletion </strong></summary>
    <p> <strong>Depletion</strong> is a measure of the current biomass of a stock relative to the average unfished biomass. </p>

  <h3>Example: Pacific Herring</h3>
  <p>Shorter-lived species, such as Pacific Herring, often exhibit large year-to-year fluctuations in stock biomass driven by large fluctuations in recruitment. Such population dynamics may suggest that more frequent stock assessment updates are required compared to longer-lived species.</p>
