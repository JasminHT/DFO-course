<h2> Unit 1.2: What is stock assessment? </h2>

<aside class='bg-info'><strong>Stock assessment</strong> is the scientific process of analyzing data to estimate the abundance and productivity of fish stocks in the past, present, and future. It is the backbone of successful science-based fisheries management. </aside>

<p>DFO is responsible for ensuring the sustainable use of fish in Canada as a renewable resource. The goal of stock assessment is to provide science advice to managers about the risks and uncertainty associated with taking different management actions. </p>

<p>Stock assessments use statistical and mathematical calculations to determine a stock’s status and, where possible, project how it will react to different management actions in the future. The results of DFO’s stock assessments are presented and validated during scientific peer review meetings. From this, science advice is generated to inform decision making.</p>

<div class='collapsible blue' id="module1">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Abundance</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Abundance (N)</strong> 
    is the total number of fish in a stock. </p>
  </details>
</div>

<div class='collapsible blue' id="module2">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Biomass</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Biomass (B) </strong> 
    is the total weight of all fish in a stock. </p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module3">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Productivity</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Productivity</strong> 
     is the rate at which biomass is generated in a stock.</p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module4">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Spawning stock biomass</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Spawning stock biomass (SSB)</strong> 
     is the total weight of all fish in a stock that have reached reproductive maturity.</p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module5">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Recruitment</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Recruitment</strong>  
     occurs when new fish are added to a population. It is measured when small or young fish grow large or old enough to be caught in a fishery (which may be affected by catch limits or gear type) or scientific survey.  </p>
  </details>
</div>


<div class='collapsible blue' id="module6">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Cohort</strong></summary>
    <p>A <strong>cohort</strong> 
     or year-class is all fish in a stock born in the same spawning year. The amount of recruitment determines the strength (in other words, relative abundance) of a cohort.</p>
  </details>
</div>




    <div class='collapsible blue' id="key2">
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Fishing mortality</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Fishing mortality (F)</strong> is the measure of deaths in a stock due to all fishing activities, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>targeted fishing</li>
    <li>  <span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Bycatch: the unintentional catch of a species when meaning to catch another. The retained portion of bycatch is called incidental catch, whereas the portion returned to the water is called discards.">bycatch</abbr></span> and discards</li>
    <li>other incidental mortality in other fisheries</li>
  </ul> 
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class='collapsible blue' id="key3">
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Natural mortality</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Natural mortality (M)</strong> is a measure of deaths in a stock due to everything other than fishing, such as:         </p>
          <ul>
          <li>predation</li>
          <li>disease</li>
          <li>prey availability</li>
          <li>competition for resources </li>
          </ul>

      </details>
    </div>

    <div class='collapsible blue' id="key4">
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Fishing effort</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Fishing effort</strong> is a measure of fishing activity using metrics such as: </p>
        <ul> 
          <li>the number of nets or lines used</li>
          <li>the number of fishing vessels deployed</li>
          <li>the number of hours spent fishing </li>
        </ul>
