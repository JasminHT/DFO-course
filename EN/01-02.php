<p>Fisheries science brings together ecology, mathematics, statistics, population dynamics, and marine biology to better understand fish stocks and fisheries so that they can be sustainably managed. It relies on best-available information and strong, collaborative relationships with stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples. </p>

<aside class='bg-info'>
  <p>The term <strong>fishery</strong> refers to the sum of all fishing activity on a resource. In Canada, fisheries may include commercial, recreational, or Indigenous food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fishing activities. </p>
  <p>Different types of fisheries are defined by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the target species (for example, Herring fishery) or groups of species (for example, groundfish or pelagic fishery)</li>
    <li>the type or style of fishing (for example, seine fishery, trawl fishery) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some fisheries operate in a specific season, while others are year-round.</p>
