<h2>Unit 1.1: Canadaâ€™s approach to fisheries science</h2>



<p>Canada currently takes a single-species approach to stock assessment. This approach looks at the impact of fishing on 1 species at a time. The results only inform management decisions about the fishery in question.</p>

<aside class='bg-info'>
<p>An <strong>ecosystem approach to fisheries management</strong> incorporates environmental considerations into stock assessments. This leads to more informed decision making because the impact of not only fishing but also ecosystem and environmental factors are included. </p></aside>

        <p>Ecosystem-based fisheries management:</p>
        <ul><li>expands the scope of the management of commercial fisheries to include simultaneous management of multiple species</li>
        <li>incorporates ecosystem variables such as water temperature, predatory-prey dynamics, and habitat</li></ul>

        <p>Ecosystem approach to fisheries management:</p>
        <ul><li>includes the management of commercial fisheries on a species-by-species basis</li>
        <li>incorporates ecosystem variables such as water temperature, predatory-prey dynamics, and habitat</li></ul>

<p>DFO is moving towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. It will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote a sustainable, economically viable, internationally competitive fishing industry</li>
  <li>improve the management of Canadian fisheries by enabling more informed decision making</li>
  <li>align with the global shift towards ecosystem approaches to fisheries management</li>
  <li>help respond to the challenges of climate change and other important ecosystem-level changes on fish stocks</li>
  <li>help meet policy obligations, international commitments, eco-certification requirements, and international trade requirements for sustainable fisheries</li>
  <li>respond to consumer demand for sustainable fisheries</li>
</ul>
