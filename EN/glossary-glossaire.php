 <p></p>
<div id='glossary'>
 
  <dl class='lst-spcd'>
  <dt>Abundance (N):</dt><dd> total number of fish in a stock.</dd>
  <dt>Assumption:</dt><dd> a statement introduced into an argument that is accepted as being true.</dd> 
  <dt>Availability </dt>
    <dd>the likelihood that a fish will enter fishing gear.</dd>
  <dt>Biomass (B):</dt><dd> the total weight of all fish in a stock.</dd>
  <dt>Bycatch:</dt><dd> the unintentional catch of a species when meaning to catch another. The retained portion of bycatch is called incidental catch, whereas the portion returned to the water is called discards.</dd>
  <dt>Carrying capacity (K):</dt><dd> stock size limited by environmental factors and resource availability (for example, food, habitat, mates).</dd>
  <dt>Catch per unit effort:</dt><dd> the quantity of fish caught with one standard unit of fishing effort (e.g., the number of fish taken per 1000 hooks per day or the weight of fish taken per hour of trawling). CPUE is often assumed to be a relative abundance index (i.e., proportional to the portion of the stock biomass (or numbers) vulnerable to the gear).</dd>
  <dt>Catchability</dt>
    <dd>a concept that reflects the efficiency of a fishery. It is the combination of availability (the likelihood that a fish will enter fishing gear) and selectivity (the likelihood of retention once a fish enters fishing gear). Gear selectivity is affected by gear design, such as mesh type and size, escape panels, hook size).</dd>
  <dt>Cohort:</dt><dd> (also known as a year-class) fish of a stock born in the same spawning year.</dd>
  <dt>Conflict of interest:</dt><dd> an interest held by a participant that may affect or be perceived to affect their objectivity and independence in contributing to the peer review process.</dd>
  <dt>Consensus:</dt><dd> an absence of opposition to the peer review meeting conclusions and advice.</dd>
  <dt>Conservation unit (CU):</dt><dd> a group of fish sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if it goes locally extinct, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally.</dd>
  <dt>Decision tables:</dt><dd> a simple way to present advice regarding the potential consequences and trade-offs of making different decisions.</dd>
  <dt>Depletion:</dt><dd> a measure of the current biomass of a stock relative to the average unfished biomass.</dd>
  <dt>Dredge:</dt><dd> a fishing method whereby a dredge is dragged across the sea floor, either scraping or penetrating the sea floor.</dd>
  <dt>Ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM):</dt><dd> incorporates ecosystem variables (for example, climate, oceanographic and ecological factors) into single-species stock assessments and scientific advice to better inform decision making. This is particularly important when predator-prey interactions indicate that management decisions on one stock have consequences to others.</dd>
  <dt>Electrofishing:</dt><dd> an electric field emitted from a pulser to temporarily stun fish that can then be collected via dip net.</dd>
  <dt>Fish:</dt><dd> in accordance with the <i>Fisheries Act</i>, the term “fish” includes: 
  <ul>
    <li>fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and marine animals</li>
    <li>any parts of fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and marine animals</li>
    <li>eggs, sperm, spawn, larvae, spat, and juvenile stages of fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and marine animals</li>
  </ul></dd>
  <dt>Fishery:</dt><dd> the sum of all fishing activity on a resource.</dd>
  <dt>Fishery-dependent data:</dt><dd> data collected directly from commercial, recreational, or Indigenous food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fisheries.</dd>
	<dt>Fishery-independent data:</dt><dd> data collected from outside of fisheries.</dd>
  <dt>Fishing effort:</dt><dd> a measure of fishing activity using metrics such as: 
    <ul>
      <li>the number of nets or lines used </li>
      <li>the number of fishing vessels deployed </li>
      <li>the number of hours spent fishing </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Fishing mortality (F):</dt><dd> measure of deaths in a stock due to all fishing activities, including:
  <ul>
    <li>targeted fishing</li>
    <li>bycatch and discards</li>
    <li>other incidental mortality in other fisheries</li>
  </ul>
</dd>
  <dt>Selectivity:</dt>
    <dd>the likelihood of retention once a fish enters fishing gear. Gear selectivity is affected by gear design, such as mesh type and size, escape panels, hook size).</dd>
  <dt>Gillnet:</dt><dd> a fishing net that is hung vertically so that fish get trapped in it by their gills.</dd>
  <dt>Groundfish:</dt><dd> (also known as demersal fish) species that live and feed on or near the seafloor.</dd>
  <dt>Harvest rate:</dt><dd> the proportion of the recruited or vulnerable biomass that is caught during a certain period, usually a fishing year (also referred to as exploitation rate).</dd>
  <dt>Hydroacoustic:</dt><dd> the study of sound in water.</dd> 
  <dt>Hyperdepletion:</dt><dd> catch declines faster than fish abundance.</dd>
  <dt>Hyperstability:</dt><dd> catch remains high as the fish stock declines.</dd>
  <dt>Indicators:</dt><dd> measurements that provide information on the state of a stock attribute of interest. A series of indicators over time creates an index.</dd> 
  <dt>Indigenous food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fishery:</dt><dd> the right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes is protected under section 35 of the Constitution. It is a collective right, not an individual one. Designated Indigenous harvesters can catch what is needed for themselves and/or their community for FSC purposes. FSC fishing does not provide an opportunity for the sale of catch. It may also occur at various times of the year, which are not always aligned with commercial fishery seasons or areas. Decisions about when a fishery is opened or closed are made through the fish management process.</dd>
  <dt>Indigenous Ways of Knowing:</dt><dd> the overarching term is used in this training to convey the multiple forms of knowledge that Indigenous Nations, governments, communities, organizations, experts, Elders, and Knowledge Holders possess and may choose to share with DFO during collaborative research, monitoring, and/or science advisory processes. There is no universal definition of Indigenous Ways of Knowing and its composition is determined by First Nations, Inuit, and Métis using their own terms.</dd> 
  <dt>Limit reference point (LRP):</dt><dd> the stock status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock.</dd>
  <dt>Longline:</dt><dd> a type of fishing gear consisting of a long main line with shorter lines with baited hooks fastened at intervals.</dd>
  <dt>Maximum sustainable yield (MSY):</dt><dd>the maximum average annual catch that can be removed from a stock over an indefinite period of time under current environmental conditions</dd>
  <ul>
    <li><dt>B<sub>MSY</sub>:</dt><dd> the stock biomass that produces the maximum sustainable yield is referred to as B<sub>MSY</sub>. </dd></li>
  </ul>
  <dt>Models :</dt> <dd>tools used to simplify a natural system so it can be more easily understood. </dd>
  <dt>Moratorium:</dt><dd> a temporary prohibition of an activity.</dd>
  <dt>Natural mortality (M):</dt><dd> measure of deaths in a stock due to everything other than fishing, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>predation</li>
    <li>disease</li>
    <li>prey availability</li>
    <li>competition for resources</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operating models:</dt><dd> computer models that simulate how fish stocks grow, reproduce, and interact with the environment.</dd>
  <dt>Otolith:</dt><dd>small structures in the inner ear with growth rings that can be counted, similar to counting tree rings.</dd>
  <dt>Parameter:</dt><dd> numbers that summarize a measurable characteristic of a stock.</dd>
  <dt>Pelagic:</dt><dd> fish inhabiting the water column of the open ocean between the surface and the seafloor.</dd> 
  <dt>Population:</dt><dd> a group of the same species that occupies a particular geographical region and interbreed.</dd>
  <dt>Precautionary approach:</dt><dd> being cautious when scientific information is uncertain, unreliable, or inadequate and not using the absence of adequate scientific information as a reason to postpone or fail to take action to avoid serious harm to a resource.</dd>
  <dt>Predictions:</dt><dd> forecast the most likely scenario.</dd>
  <dt>Probability:</dt><dd> the extent to which an event or scenario is likely to occur.</dd>
  <dt>Productivity:</dt><dd> the rate at which biomass is generated in a stock.</dd>

  <dt>Quota:</dt><dd> see definition for <a href="#tac">Total Allowable Catch (TAC)</a></dd>
  <dt>Recruitment:</dt><dd> occurs when new fish are added to a population. It is measured when small or young fish grow large or old enough to be caught in a fishery (which may be affected by catch limits or gear type) or scientific survey.</dd> 
  <dt>Reference point:</dt><dd> a benchmark against which the biomass or abundance of the stock or the fishing mortality rate (or exploitation rate) can be measured in order to determine its status. These reference points can be targets, thresholds or limits depending on their intended use.</dd>
  <dt>Removal reference:</dt><dd> the maximum removal rate of a fish stock. </dd>
  <dt>Rights-holders:</dt><dd> modern successors to the Indigenous collectives that signed treaties, occupied and used land, and engaged in historic practices that support a finding of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title. Aboriginal rights are the collective rights of Indigenous Peoples flowing from their status as the original peoples of Canada and can vary from nation to nation and community to community. They refer to practices, traditions, and customs integral to the distinctive culture of an Indigenous collective. These rights are site, community, and fact-specific, and depend on historical facts. Treaty rights are rights of Indigenous Peoples that are either established in or codified in Crown-Indigenous treaties. Aboriginal title is one type of Aboriginal right. It means the right to have control over the use and occupation of specific land.</dd>  
  <dt>Seine:</dt><dd> a fishing net that hangs vertically in the water with floats at the top and weights at the bottom; the ends are drawn together to encircle the fish.</dd>
  <dt>Sensitivity analysis:</dt><dd> allow scientists to explore the impacts of uncertainty and assumptions by testing different scenarios (e.g., random variation in recruitment or different environmental factors affecting natural mortality). They are sometimes included alongside science advice for context. </dd>
  <dt>Serious harm:</dt><dd> a fish stock experiencing serious harm may be depleted to the point where it has impaired productivity or reproductive capacity. As a result, the stock would be less resilient to fishing and could not easily rebuild. Serious harm may be irreversible, or only slowly reversible over the long-term, and can be due to fishing, other human-induced impacts, or natural causes.</dd>

  <dt>Spawning potential ratio:</dt><dd> number of eggs produced by a fish stock under specific fishing conditions relative to number of eggs that would be produced if it is not fished.</dd>
  <dt>Spawning stock biomass (SSB):</dt><dd> the total weight of all fish in a stock that have reached reproductive maturity.</dd>
  <dt>Stakeholders:</dt><dd> for this training, individuals or organizations with an interest in the science and management of fisheries and the marine environment.</dd>
  <dt>Steepness:</dt><dd> (also known as recruitment compensation) measure of juvenile fish survival under conditions where there is little to no competition for resources.</dd>
  <dt>Stock:</dt><dd> groups of the same species with a shared characteristic(s) of interest to managers.</dd>
  <dt>Stock assessment:</dt><dd> the scientific process of analyzing data to evaluate the abundance and productivity  of fish stocks in the past, present, and future.</dd>
  <dt>Stock management unit (SMU):</dt><dd> collections of stocks that are managed together with a joint stock status.</dd>
  <dt>Stock status:</dt><dd> refers to a determination made, on the basis of stock assessment results, about the current condition of the stock.</dd>
  <dt>Target reference point (TRP):</dt><dd> the overall stock level target.</dd>
  <dt><a id="tac"></a>Total allowable catch (TAC):</dt><dd> a catch limit set for a particular fishery.</dd>
  <dt>Trap:</dt><dd>static fishing gear that work passively to entangle or trap fish that move towards or into it.</dd>
  <dt>Trawling:</dt><dd> a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net that is heavily weighted to keep it on the seafloor through the water behind 1 or more boats. The net used for trawling is called a trawl.</dd>
  <dt>Uncertainty:</dt><dd> the incompleteness of knowledge about a natural system.</dd>
  <dt>Upper stock reference point (USR):</dt><dd> a threshold below which fishing must be reduced to avoid reaching the limit reference point.</dd>
  <dt>Unfished biomass:</dt><dd> total weight of fish that would exist in a stock if it is not fished.</dd>
  <dt>Unfished recruitment:</dt><dd> expected recruitment if the fish stock is not fished.</dd>
