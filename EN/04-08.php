<ul class='summary lst-spcd'>
  
<li>The Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) coordinates the development of science advice for DFO. </li>

<li>Peer review meetings are where technical review and challenge of scientific information occurs. This leads to consensus-based science advice. The objective of peer review meetings is to provide sound, objective, and impartial science advice. They are not consultations. </li>

<li>Consensus is an absence of opposition to peer review meeting conclusions and advice based on scientific data and information. It is not based on external considerations, such as potential impacts of future decisions.</li>

<li>Peer review meeting participants must have the relevant expertise required to engage constructively in questions and comment on and challenge scientific information and interpretations presented. Participants must play an active role in arriving at consensus of conclusions and must commit to taking part as objective experts. </li>

<li>A conflict of interest is an interest held by a participant that may affect or be perceived to affect the participantâ€™s objectivity and independence in contributing to the peer review process. It is critical to identify and manage real, perceived, and potential conflicts of interest throughout the CSAS process.</li>

<li>CSAS publications include Science Advisory Reports, Research Documents, and Science Responses. </li>
