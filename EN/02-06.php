<h2>Unit 2.2: Data collection</h2>


<p>Survey methods should aim to be consistent so that data is comparable over time. Some strategies include sampling:</p>
<ul>
  <li> using the same vessel and gear</li>
  <li> at the same locations</li>
  <li> at the same time of day</li>
  <li> for the same duration </li>
  <li> at randomly selected sites from the same gridded area</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeated surveys (for example, annually) provide a time series of data that can show how stocks change over time. </p>

<p>Surveys can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fixed: sample the same unit (place, individual) over time</li>
  <li>random: equal chance of sampling any unit in the stock</li>
  <li>random stratified: equal chance of sampling any unit within subsets of the stock</li>
</ul>

<p>Locations for fishery-independent sampling are often selected using a random stratified approach: a geographic area is divided into sections (known as strata) based on certain criteria (for example, square kilometres, depth). Strata can be randomly selected to more accurately reflect the entire stock in the data.</p>

  <h4>Key concept: </h4>
  <p>DFO encourages Indigenous monitoring that engages local skills and Indigenous Ways of Knowing. This builds long-term data sets that can help conserve stocks while respecting culture and autonomy.</p>

  <h3>Example: Community-based fishery-independent monitoring in the western Canadian Arctic </h3>
  <p>Subsistence fisheries in the Arctic play a critical role in Indigenous cultural identity, economic resilience, and food security. In the Northwest Territories Inuvialuit Settlement Region and Gwich’in Settlement Area, Indigenous co-management partners identified historical declines of Arctic Char and Dolly Varden and expressed a desire to monitor priority stocks. </p>

  <p>Following a standardized approach, Inuit and Gwich’in monitors collect data at traditional camps.</p>

  <p>They are responsible for determining: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  when to start data collection</li>
    <li>  where to set nets </li>
    <li>  sampling location</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Inuit and Gwich’in monitors review and help interpret results with DFO at annual working group meetings to inform <span class="gc-dwnld-info"><abbr title="Stock status: refers to a determination made, on the basis of stock assessment results, about the current condition of the stock.">stock status</abbr></span>. </p>
